# Tk Password Generator
 A simple password generator made with python and tkinter.

 This is my first project. Made it on windows. I didn't try it on Linux (yet).

## The passwords
 The random passwords are generated with the python `secrets` module, and can be copied to the clipboard.  
 The passwords lenght can be 1-50 characters long. They can have uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols, depending on user choice.

## Multi-language support
The app supports both English (default) and Spanish. By default, if the OS language is Spanish, the app will display its text in Spanish, or in English if the OS is in any other language. The user can force a language in the language options, clicking the translation icon in the upper right corner.
