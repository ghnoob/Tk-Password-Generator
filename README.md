# Tk Password Generator
 A simple password generator made with python and tkinter.

 This is my first project. Made it on windows. I didn't try it on Linux (yet).

## The passwords
 The random passwords are generated with the python `secrets` module, and can be copied to the clipboard.  
 The passwords lenght can be 1-50 characters long. They can have uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols, depending on user choice.

## Multi-language support (WIP)
The app supports both English (default) and Spanish.
