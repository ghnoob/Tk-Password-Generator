# Tk Password Generator
 A simple password generator made with python and tkinter.

 This is my first project. Made it on windows. I didn't try it on Linux (yet).

## The passwords
 The random passwords are generated with the secrets module, and can be copied to the clipboard or saved as .txt files.  
 The passwords lenght can be 1-50 characters long. They can have uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols, depending on user choice.

## Multi-language support
The app supports both English (default) and Spanish.  

If the OS language is Spanish, the app uses the Spanish language files. Else, it uses the English as default language.
