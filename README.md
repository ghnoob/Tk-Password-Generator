# Tk Password Generator
 A simple password generator made with python and tkinter.

 This is my first project. Made it on windows. I didn't try it on Linux (yet).

## The passwords
 The random passwords are generated with the secrets module, and can be copied to the clipboard or saved as .txt files.  
 The passwords lenght can be 1-50 characters long. They can have uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols, depending on user choice.

## Multi-language support
The app supports both English (default) and Spanish.  

To change the language, edit `lang.txt` in `locales` folder.
+ To set the app in English, write _en_ in the file.
+ To set the app in Spanish, write _es_ in the file.
_**Note:** do not delete the file or write anything else to prevent errors._
